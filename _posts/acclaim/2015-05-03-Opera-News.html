snippet: "As Ramiro, American tenor David Portillo commanded attention from the start just by producing more volume than anyone else onstage. Considerable musicalityemerged, too. Portilloâ€™s account of DzSi, ritrovarla io giuro,dz in particular, stood out as much for the technical fluency as for the subtlety of expression. A few pinched top notes aside, the vibrant singing gave the production a nice lift; so did Portillo's acting, notably during slyly funny business in his first scene involving the disguised prince's befuddled attempt to use a broom, clearly for the first time"
