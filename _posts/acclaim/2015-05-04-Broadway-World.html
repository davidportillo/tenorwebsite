snippet: "Performance-wise the evening belonged to Erraught, Bordogna and David Portillo as our prince, Don Ramiro.  David Portillo and Simone Alberghini were delighful as Don Ramiro and his valet Dandini. In a break with the traditional Cinderella fairy tale, the prince and the valet switch identities so as to better observe potential brides. When the rouse is revealed, Portillo is at his best displaying full charm as he searches for the woman who captured his heart with passionate "Si, ritrovarla io guiro."
