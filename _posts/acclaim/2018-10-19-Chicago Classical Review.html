snippet: "David Portillo brought a vibrant, liquid tenor to the role of Arbace, the king’s devoted councilor. He showed fine
flexibility in “Se l too duol, se il mo desio,” rounded off with a gamely flamboyant cadenza. Portillo brought such
supple, elegant expression to Arbace’s Act 3 recitative that one felt the loss of his ensuing aria (“Se cola ne’ fat e
scritto”) even more."
