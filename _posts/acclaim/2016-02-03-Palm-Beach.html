snippet: "The American tenor David Portillo was an excellent Ernesto, with an ardent, almost-tragic sound to his voice that worked well to bring out the intensity of the character. He was particularly fine in his Act II aria DzCercheró lontana terradz and in the Act III serenade DzComè gentil,dz where in both cases the keening, sensual coloring of his voice could be heard at its most forceful. And in the final duet with Norina, the voice gained even more warmth as the lovers’ thirds entwined."
