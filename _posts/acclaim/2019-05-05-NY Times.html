snippet: "Blanche’s brother, the Chevalier de la Force (the sweet-voiced tenor David Portillo in an endearing performance), shares
his father’s concerns about Blanche. As they talk, revolution is fomenting right outside their home. Mr. Nézet-Séguin
emphasized every slashing chord and tumultuous outburst during this scene. I’ve never heard it performed with such
ferocity."
