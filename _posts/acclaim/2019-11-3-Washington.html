snippet: 'David Portillo excelled as Tamino, a sterling lyric tenor with a sweet ring in the top notes and a princely stage presence. The combination of vocal elements in Portillo’s voice was nearly ideal. The heroic high notes were present, as in the opening scene with the dragon, but with a dulcet lyricism. The legato soft side was meltingly smooth and tender, as in the Act I aria “Dies Bildnis ist bezaubernd schön.”'
