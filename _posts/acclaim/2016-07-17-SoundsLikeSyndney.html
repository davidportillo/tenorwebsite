snippet: "The American tenor David Portillo was making his debut with Opera Australia, and a welcome one it was, too. His voice is well suited to Mozart: clear, well projected and with a comfortable top register that showed no sense of strain. His delivery of Un’ aura amorosa was punctuated by intense silences which held the audience enthralled,  In Act 2, his Tradito, schernito was biting and passionate."
