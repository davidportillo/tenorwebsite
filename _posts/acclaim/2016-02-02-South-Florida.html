snippet: "David Portillo was the dulcet-voiced Ernesto. Highly impressive two seasons ago in a Palm Beach Barber of Seville and recently with a recital of Spanish song in Miami, this fine lyric tenor goes from strength to strength. He brought aching sadness to a meltingly beautiful DzMa fa il destinodz and phrased DzComé gentildz with grace. Portillo’s top range was free and unrestricted and he blended wonderfully in duet withBrugger.  Displaying unflagging strength and momentum throughout the three acts, Portillo is the model of a first-rate bel canto tenor."
