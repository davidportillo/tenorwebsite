snippet: "Portillo brought down the house with his aria “Ecco spiano. Ecco il mio trillo” towards the end of Act 2; the aria
requires the singer to demonstrate mezza voce, trills, syncopation, arpeggio, staccato, and castrati-like falsetto.
Dressed in tuxedo with a music stand in front of a closed curtain, Portillo interacted with the musicians in the pit
while singing the challenging aria and appeared to be enjoying himself."
