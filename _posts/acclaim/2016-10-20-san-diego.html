snippet: "David Portillo, as Ramiro, was a princely tenor with bright and supple tone. He was plaintive in the throes of love, formidable when threatening punishment, and hilarious in the duet DzZitto, zitto; piano, piano,dz sneaking from tree to tree or crawling across the stage with his valet, Dandini."
