        <p class="bio-p">
          Praised by Opera News for “high notes with ease, singing with a luxuriant warm glow that seduced the ear as he bounded about
          the stage with abandon,” American tenor David Portillo has established himself as a leading classical singer of
          his generation. An exciting 2018-2019 season includes a return to the Metropolitan Opera for a role debut as the
          Chevalier de la Force in Dialogues des Carmélites, a debut at the Bolshoi as Count Libenskof in Il viaggio a Reims,
          a return to the Lyric Opera of Chicago for Arbace in Idomeneo with Sir Andrew Davis, an opera he will perform for
          his debut with the Teatro Real in Madrid, but as Idamante, and finally Oper Frankfurt and the Glyndebourne Festival
          as Tamino in Die Zauberflöte. On two separate occasions in the season, Mr. Portillo will return to his hometown
          of San Antonio, Texas for a role debut as Alfredo in La traviata with Opera San Antonio, as well as a solo orchestral
          program of Italian repertoire with the San Antonio Symphony and Sebastian Lang-Lessing. Orchestral engagements
          include a return to the Los Angeles Philharmonic for Beethoven’s Mass in C Major, and Haydn’s Lord Nelson Mass
          with Gustavo Dudamel, an appearance with Grant Gershon and the Los Angeles Master Chorale for Mozart’s Requiem,
          and Carmina Burana with DePaul University as part of the opening celebrations of the Holtschneider Performance
          Center.

          In the 2017-2018 season, David Portillo made a splash in two role debuts at the Metropolitan Opera, first as Eduardo in Thomas
          Adès’ North American premiere of The Exterminating Angel, then as Camille de Rosillon in The Merry Widow. He performed
          Count Almaviva in Il barbiere di Siviglia with Houston Grand Opera, and Don Ottavio in Don Giovanni for his debut
          with Dallas Opera. In the summer of 2018, Mr. Portillo made two important house debuts, at the Deutsche Oper Berlin
          as Count Libenskof, and the Bayerische Staatsoper as Pasquale in Orlando Paladino. Orchestral highlights of the
          season included Mozart’s Requiem with Gustavo Dudamel and the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl.

          For the 2016-2017 season, David Portillo made his Australian debut singing Ferrando in Così fan tutte with Opera Australia,
          in a new production by Sir David McVicar, conducted by Jonathan Darlington. Other roles included a return to the
          Metropolitan Opera as Jacquino in Fidelio conducted by Sebastian Weigle, Tamino for his debut with Oper Frankfurt,
          Pedrillo in Die Entführung aus dem Serail for a debut with Dutch National Opera, Don Ramiro in La Cenerentola with
          San Diego Opera, and Dr. Richardson in the world-premiere performances of Breaking the Waves at Opera Philadelphia.
          Concert performances included an international tour of Handel’s Ariodante in the role of Lurcanio, conducted by
          Harry Bicket with tour stops in New York, London, Vienna and Paris, among others. In Japan, Mr. Portillo performed
          Count Almaviva with Marc Minkowski and Ensemble Kanazawa.
